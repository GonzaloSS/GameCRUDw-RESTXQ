# GAME CRUD WITH RESTXQ PROJECT

## Today I'm showing you a crud maket it with BASE X and Visual Studio Code



#### Resources for this project

    XML
    XQM
    HTML

#### Apps link that I used for this project


- Visual Studio Code: https://code.visualstudio.com

- Base X: http://basex.org/download/


The firt step was make a xml on Base X, then I use Visual Studio Code for make the .xqm(RESTXQ) and finally again in the Visual Studio Code I finished the HTML pages.

## If you use my GameCRUD then here are the links:

- localhost:8984/allgames
- localhost:8984/deletegame
- localhost:8984/updategame
- localhost:8984/addgames

Anyways, there are a lot of links but they are used for a crosspoint with the XML to do the CRUD like /game/add or something.


## So that's all, hope you like this project and see you on the next project!!!!
